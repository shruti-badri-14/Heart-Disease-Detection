# Heart Disease Prediction

In a fast-paced modern world, health often takes a back seat to daily habits, making early
detection and intervention imperative. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which claim the lives of
approximately 17.9 million people each year, require proactive measures. In the initial phase, we
built comprehensive models using methods such as Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Decision Trees,
Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest powered by a dataset from the University
of California, Irvine (UCI) Risk Assessment Repository. We meticulously identified CVD risk
using features to assess cardiovascular disease risk, prioritize early intervention, and promote
lifestyle changes. The project followed a systematic approach with CRISP-DM phases, ensuring
thorough understanding, preparation, modeling, and evaluation. Rigorous model evaluation,
including techniques like cross-validation and metrics such as AUC-ROC, Precision, F1 score
ensured the utmost accuracy and reliability. Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, XGBoost,
and Decision Tree classification models were implemented. The SVM classifier emerged as the
top performer among the baseline models, achieving an accuracy of 93.33%, coupled with a
validation accuracy of 97.7%. Additionally, the Random Forest model demonstrated good
accuracy, reaching 94%. The experimental results underscore the superior performance of the
SVM and Random Forest models compared to the other methods, albeit with an associated increase
in execution cost. Thus, they holistically contributed to the project's overarching goal of saving
lives, reducing healthcare costs, and improving overall health. By providing early detection
capabilities, the effort envisions a world where heart health thrives, bringing comfort and vitality
to all.
